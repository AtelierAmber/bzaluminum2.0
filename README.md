### Localization




## Description

"And I am nothing of a builder / But here I dreamt I was an architect" - *Colin Meloy*

----
_WARNING -- This mod is currently an alpha. It is still being tested. There may be deadlocks to be fixed. Major changes may yet come._

----

Adds aluminum ore, alumina, aluminum plates, cables, alloys, spark plugs, and more to the game.

Largely retaining the vanilla factorio feel, this mod provides a small rework to the burner phase early game, as well as many later recipe updates. It also requires the [Foundry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzfoundry) building.

If used alongside most of the other BZ mods, the game will become quite a bit more complex. As always with BZ resource mods, the game is not extended much past the rocket launch, instead the game is a lot wider up to that point. For a post-rocket-launch extension, consider using this mod alongside Krastorio2, Space Exploration, or both.

If you want a vanilla-esque game with some tweaks, try this mod, or perhaps a less complex one like [Titanium](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bztitanium) or [Lead](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzlead).

### Details

Aluminum ore can be smelted to alumina. It also outputs silica if using [Silica & Silicon](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzsilicon). Alumina is used in some recipes and can be smelted to aluminum plates, which is used for aluminum cable and ACSR cable. Aluminum replaces copper in most early recipes. Copper and green circuits are locked behind research and not needed until electronics. Alloys are later unlocked consisting of aluminum and a variety of other resources. Warning, if using alongside [Lead](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzlead), you'll need to hoard copper byproduct until you research copper processing.

Supported compatible mods:

- Space Exploration & AAI
- Krastorio 2 & Rich Rocks Requiem
- Several smaller mods like Deadlock Stacking, Deadlock Crating, etc.

Coming soon: FE+, 5Dim's, ModMash, etc.
Planned but not yet supported: RSO, Omnimatter, Simple Compress, and much more.

Many other mods are compatible, but not yet fully supported. Compatibility suggestions always appreciated.
